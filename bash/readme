# User Data Processor

This Bash script processes user data from text file  and performs the following tasks:

- Trims leading and trailing spaces from `name`, `email`, and `id` fields.
- Validates that the `id` is numeric and not empty.
- Checks that the email is a valid FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) email format.
- Determines if the `id` is even or odd and prints an appropriate message.
- Logs warnings for invalid `id` or `email` entries without halting the script.

## Features

1. **Input File**:  
   The script reads data from a file (`users.txt` by default), where each line contains a `name`, `email`, and `id` separated by commas.

2. **ID Validation**:
   - The script checks whether the `id` is numeric and non-empty.
   - If the `id` is missing or not a valid number, a warning is printed and the entry is skipped, No further processing is done for this user (no email check, no even/odd ID check).

3. **Email Validation**:
   - After the script ensures that the `id` is valid, It ensures that the email follows a valid FQDN format using a regular expression.
   - If the `email` is unvalid, a warning is printed and the entry is skipped. No further processing is done for this user (no even/odd ID check).

4. **Even/Odd Check**:
   - For valid entries(ID and Email), the script checks whether the `id` is even or odd and prints a corresponding message.

5. **Warnings**:
   - Any invalid `id` or `email` entry triggers a warning, but the script continues processing the remaining lines in the input file.
