# Newman Docker Image

<!-- This repository contains a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image that uses Newman, the command-line collection runner for Postman. This image is built in two stages to ensure a lightweight final image while including additional features such as a custom reporter.

## Summary -->

I used a multi-stage build process to build the image:

1. **Build Stage**:
   - Base image: `postman/newman:5.3-alpine` with builder label.
   - Updates the Alpine package manager and upgrades existing packages.
   - Installs additional packages such as `curl`, `zip`, and `ping`.
   - Installs the `newman-reporter-csvallinone` package globally.
   - Cleans up the npm cache and removes unnecessary files to reduce image size.

2. **Final Stage**:
   - Again uses the `postman/newman:5.3-alpine` image as the base.
   - Copies the installed Node modules from the builder stage to the final image.
   - Copies a custom `resolv.conf` file to configure DNS settings.
   - Sets the `NODE_PATH` environment variable to include globally installed Node modules.
   - Sets the working directory to `/etc/newman`.
   - Configures the entry point to the Newman command, allowing users to run Newman commands directly when the container is started.

## Usage

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the directory containing the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t newman-image .
